# call-forwarding-voicemail-python

# Forward calls to voicemail for beginners. Powered by Twilio - Python/Flask

This is an application example implementing an automated phone line using
Python 3.12.2 and [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) web framework.

## Local Development

This project is built using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) web framework.

1. First clone this repository and `cd` into it.
        ```bash
        $ git clone git@github.com:twilio-samples/call-forwarding-voicemail-python.git
        $ cd call-forwarding-voicemail-python
        ```

1. Create a new virtual environment.

    - If using vanilla [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/):

        ```bash
        virtualenv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

    - If using [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/):

        ```bash
        mkvirtualenv call-forwarding-voicemail-python
        ```

1. Install the dependencies.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```


1. Start the server.

    ```bash
    flask run
    ```

1. Expose the application to the wider Internet using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).

    ```bash
    ngrok http 5000 
    ```

1. Configure Twilio to call your webhooks

  You will also need to configure Twilio to call your application when calls are
  received in your [*Twilio Number*](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/messaging/phone-numbers).
  The voice url should look something like this:

  ```
  http://<your-ngrok-subdomain>.ngrok-free.app/webhook
  ```
